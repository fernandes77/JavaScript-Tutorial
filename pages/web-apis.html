    <h1>Introduction to web APIs</h1>
    <h2>What are APIs?</h2>
    <p>
      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in
      programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality
      more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you.<br />
      JavaScript has <strong>browser APIs</strong> and
      <strong>third-party APIs</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2>What can APIs do?</h2>
    <p>Providing answers with examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manipulate documents: DOM;</li>
      <li>Fetch data from the server: Fetch API;</li>
      <li>Drawing and manipulating graphics: Canvas and WebGL;</li>
      <li>Manipulate audio and video: HTMLMediaElement;</li>
      <li>Device APIs: Notifications API;</li>
      <li>Client-side storage APIs: Web Storage API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some common third-party APIs are Twitter API, Youtube API, Google Maps API
      and Telegram API.
    </p>
    <h2>How do APIs work?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        APIs are based on objects. Every bit of functionality is found inside
        the object's methods;
      </li>
      <li>
        APIs have entry points. For the DOM API it is the
        <strong>Document</strong> object. For the Web Audio API it is the
        <strong>AudioContext</strong> object;
      </li>
      <li>
        APIs change their state with events. They usually have a ton of event
        handlers;
      </li>
      <li>APIs have some additional security mechanisms in place.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Manipulating documents</h1>
    <p>
      When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want
      to do is manipulate the document structure in some way. This is usually
      done by using the Document Object Model (DOM), a set of APIs for
      controlling HTML and styling information.
    </p>
    <h2>The important parts of a web browser</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The window is the browser tab that a web page is loaded into; this is
        represented in JavaScript by the <strong>Window</strong> object;
      </li>
      <li>
        The navigator represents the state and identity of the browser (i.e. the
        user-agent) as it exists on the web. In JavaScript, this is represented
        by the <strong>Navigator</strong> object.
      </li>
      <li>
        The document (represented by the DOM in browsers) is the actual page
        loaded into the window, and is represented in JavaScript by the
        <strong>Document</strong> object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The document object model</h2>
    <p>Each one of the elements in the html tree is called a node.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Root node: the html node;</li>
      <li>Child node: a node directly inside another node;</li>
      <li>Descendant node: a node anywhere inside another node;</li>
      <li>Parent node: a node with another node inside it;</li>
      <li>Sibling nodes: nodes that sit on the same level in the node tree;</li>
      <li>Text node: a node that contains text.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My shopping list</h2>
    <label for="item">Enter a new item:</label>
    <input type="text" name="item" id="item">
    <button class="add-item">Add item</button>
    <ul class="item-list">
      
    </ul>
  </body>
